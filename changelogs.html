<h1 id="changelogs" class="fh-1" style="text-align: center;">Changelogs</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to the Bloxstrap changelogs page! Here, you can explore all the updates and enhancements weâ€™ve made to improve your experience with our app. Weâ€™re committed to continuously updating and refining Bloxstrap to ensure it delivers the best functionality and user experience.</p>
<p>Below, youâ€™ll find detailed information on the new features and bug fixes included in each version. You can also download the latest version of Bloxstrap, as well as previous versions, from our <a href="dl.html">Download page</a>. For more information about Bloxstrap and its capabilities, visit the <a href="index.html">Bloxstrap Home Page</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Bloxstrap and for supporting its development. ðŸ˜Š</p>

<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.8.1</h2>
<h3>Removals</h3>
<p>The engine setting preset for the Roblox escape menu version has been removed. It's become increasingly unstable over time as Roblox continues to make breaking changes to how it works. It may be re-added at a later date when we can support it properly.</p>

<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We've made changes to what analytics we collect. We no longer log package download states, but we do now log exceptions that occur. See the privacy policy for more information about that.</li>
    <li>In the main menu, pressing the tab key now jumps to selecting the "Launch Roblox" button.</li>
    <li>We've added the ability to easily export diagnostic data through Bloxstrap Settings.</li>
    <li>We've also added the option to use the classic Bloxstrap logo in the bootstrapper for those who prefer it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Roblox launch detection has been improved and should no longer false-flag for some users.</li>
    <li>Roblox can now be run as an Administrator.</li>
    <li>Firefox launch issues should now be fixed.</li>
    <li>Fixed connectivity errors in the bootstrapper not being properly handled.</li>
    <li>Improved Roblox upgrade reliability.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where deleting a modded file could cause an exception on launch.</li>
    <li>Fixed the "Open log file" option not showing in the activity tracker menu.</li>
    <li>Fixed exclusive fullscreen not working, and the "Allow Bloxstrap to manage Fast Flags" option is now back.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug where choosing an emoji mod preset could cause an exception.</li>
    <li>Fixed issues with phantom Bloxstrap processes hanging in the background.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.8.0</h2>

<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>There is now an analytics system, which will be enabled by default. See the <a href="privacy-policy.html">privacy policy</a> for more information about that. You can disable it in Bloxstrap Settings under the "Bloxstrap" tab.</li>
    <li>Featuring the ability to view your game history, allowing you to see a summary of your play session or quickly rejoin servers.</li>
    <li>Featuring the ability to show what Roblox account you're playing with on your Discord Rich Presence activity. </li>
    <li>Featuring a new tool called "test mode", which allows you to easily test how your configured settings actually affect Roblox.</li>
    <li>BloxstrapRPC now features the ability to set launch data for invite deeplinks.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bloxstrap now has a proper installation UI, instead of showing all the options at once when you use it for the first time.</li>
    <li>Bloxstrap now has a general launch menu. Running the Bloxstrap executable directly now shows this menu instead of just launching Roblox.</li>
    <li>It's now possible to cancel the bootstrapper when Roblox is in the middle of launching.</li>
    <li>Bloxstrap now verifies if Roblox launches properly.</li>
    <li>Bloxstrap now remembers the position and size of your Settings window.</li>
    <li>Reporting a GitHub issue through the exception dialog now automatically includes the corresponding log file.</li>
    <li>Bloxstrap now warns you of unsaved changes when you close the Settings window.</li>
    <li>If your settings fail to load, Bloxstrap now warns you about that.</li>
    <li>Added an easy option for resetting the FastFlag configuration back to defaults.</li>
    <li>When installing/upgrading Roblox, the progress is now shown in the taskbar.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>"Bloxstrap Menu" is now called "Bloxstrap Settings", or just "Settings". The dedicated shortcut for it is also now gone. To get to it, use the "Bloxstrap" shortcut.</li>
    <li>By default, there is now only one singular "Bloxstrap" shortcut which opens the launch menu. In settings, you can choose to create shortcuts for specifically opening settings or launching Roblox.</li>
    <li>Bloxstrap now installs Roblox to a static \Roblox\Player\ folder, instead of a constantly changing \Versions\version-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\ folder. Therefore, it is now possible to make applications locate RobloxPlayerBeta without worrying about the location changing.</li>
    <li>The option for disabling fullscreen optimizations is now handled through compatibility settings.</li>
    <li>"Fast Flags" are now referred to as "Engine Settings" to better reflect their purpose for general users.</li>
    <li>Bloxstrap now shows friendly, helpful error messages when unable to write to the registry or when the install process fails.</li>
    <li>When creating a custom integration, the name is now autofilled when you choose an application.</li>
    <li>Discord Rich Presence no longer displays the word "Playing" on your activity details, now just showing the game name.</li>
    <li>The "Behaviour" tab in Settings has been split into two smaller tabs: "Bootstrapper" and "Bloxstrap".</li>
    <li>Better bootstrapper error handling allows Roblox to continue launching even if there's a connectivity error.</li>
    <li>All options in Bloxstrap Settings (such as configuration of mod presets) now take effect only when you click the Save button.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bloxstrap's installation system has been completely rewritten. Besides the new installer UI, the new system should be far more stable, addressing all previous issues.</li>
    <li>Fixed flag presets being cleared when setting the texture quality to Automatic.</li>
    <li>Negative font sizes can now be set in the flag preset for the font size flag, allowing text to be made smaller than default.</li>
    <li>The flag preset for the legacy escape menu options has been fixed.</li>
    <li>Fixed font file validation (#2982).</li>
    <li>PlaceFilter flags are now properly supported in the flag editor.</li>
    <li>Importing a flag with a null value no longer causes a crash.</li>
    <li>Sorting the table by value no longer breaks things.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Removals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The option for the advanced graphics quality slider is now gone, as it broke some time back.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Localisation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Malay and Czech are now supported languages.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.7.0</h2>
    <h3>Additions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Localization has been fully implemented! By default, it follows your system language, but you can manually choose one in the Bloxstrap Menu's appearance tab too. Massive thank you to all the translators who contributed!</li>
        <li>In the flag editor, the JSON import utility now allows you to easily import from a file.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to easily disable the configuration of any Fast Flags (intended for troubleshooting purposes).</li>
        <li>Added the ability to use unsupported Roblox app languages.</li>
        <li>Added the ability to easily open Roblox's current log file through the activity tracker menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Existing Changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On version upgrade, the new release notes now open in a webpage instead of just a notification popping up.</li>
        <li>The prompt to confirm second instance launching is now optional, being disabled by default.</li>
        <li>Bootstrapper styles have now been given more sensible names.</li>
        <li>The presets section of the Fast Flags tab has been given a complete refresh, with loads more options, and fixes for problematic presets.</li>
        <li>A proper error message is now shown for downloads that failed verification.</li>
        <li>Functionality for custom integrations has been vastly improved, with the added ability to specify files instead of only executables, applications now launching with the same working folder as the executable's location, and a file picker dialog.</li>
        <li>Exception dialog message now makes reference to the Wiki, telling you to read it first before opening an issue.</li>
        <li>Improved readability of the menu alert bar (#2219).</li>
        <li>Scroll bars in the Bloxstrap Menu are now always shown.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed inconsistent handling of desktop app closing for "Don't exit to desktop app" integration.</li>
        <li>Fixed performance bug with the activity tracker (which was also contributing to the above issue).</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with installation erroring if the given path had a lowercase drive letter (thank you @cryolithic!).</li>
        <li>Fixed BloxstrapRPC not working under certain foreign system locales.</li>
        <li>Fixed bug with JSON exporter in the flag editor erroring when copying to the clipboard.</li>
        <li>Fully implemented flag editor validation, now validating flag types and values too.</li>
        <li>Added handler for if a log file cannot be written (#2135).</li>
    </ul>
<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.6.1</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed the Git hash being included in the version number. That's a recent .NET change that I forgot to account for.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="fh-3" style="color: red;">v2.6.5</h2>
<h3>Additions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>New launcher styles! Now being closer to the contemporary Roblox launcher, especially the new Mac launcher.</li>
    <li>If you launch Roblox while you're already in a Roblox game, you'll be prompted for confirmation so that you don't close your existing game by accident (#606).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Existing Changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The flag for Bloxstrap FPS unlocking is now not set unless necessary.</li>
    <li>Menu footer now follows Windows 11 Mica colouring.</li>
    <li>The "Disable desktop app" mod option is now the "Don't exit to desktop app" integration. This also fixes the issue of Roblox crashing when exiting a game. Activity tracking is required for this to work.</li>
    <li>Big scary warnings have been added to the Fast Flag editor. Spooky. If you're confused as to where it is, it's at the bottom.</li>
    <li>Saving your changes in the menu is now non-destructive, and does not close it anymore.</li>
    <li>Activity tracker information fetching is now more efficient.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

    <li>Connectivity checking is now much more efficient in the event of network failures.</li>
    <li>Having a custom font configured on first installation no longer causes the install process to error.</li>
    <li>Fixed permission errors when trying to remove a custom font.</li>
    <li>Added support for recent changes in Roblox's deployment system which was causing those "403 (Forbidden)" errors that forced me to release this in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Removals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Multi-instance launching has now been removed.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed option for font modding not showing on older versions of Windows.</li>
